# Run script

`python3 app.py <github_link> <name>`

Result will be import_graph.html in localhost:5500/import_graph.html

# Issues/Improvements I could have made
1. List out all the different imports when you click a node
2. `is_import_local` wasn't working as intended
3. Added different colors between downloaded library imports vs local imports
